## Background

This app was originally designed to make it easier to count up item orders at a community food bank in San Francisco. At the end of each distribution, we would have about 100 slips of paper listing the items distributed to each person.

At some point, we started counting up how many people had asked for each item, which was useful information for future ordering & planning. At first, someone was counting by just flipping through the slips and counting all the tomatoes, then flipping through and counting all the bananas, etc. This was very time consuming!

This app was created to make the counting process easier. The idea is that you take a slip listing the items distributed, tap a button for each item that is highlighted on the slip, then move on to the next one. Each tap increments the count for a given item, and at the end, you have all your counts. Way faster!
